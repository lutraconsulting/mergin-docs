title: Synchronising data between devices and PCs
---

In this post, we will synchronise the [data collected in the previous tutorial](./using-input.html) to Mergin. This will allow us to see the collected data on the PC using QGIS.

# Synchronising data
The data you have captured on your phone can be synchronised through the Mergin service.

In Input app, select **Projects** and then **My projects**. You should see a double arrow on the right side of the **Potholes survey**.

Select the double arrow to sync your project. You can also open QGIS from your PC/laptop and synchronise changes back to your desktop:

In QGIS, from the **Browser Panel** under **Mergin > My projects** right-click on **Potholes survey** and select **Synchronize**

After synchronising is completed, you should be able to see the point and its associated form on your QGIS.
