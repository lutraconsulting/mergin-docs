You can delete a Mergin project either on your PC (locally) or on the Mergin server. To be able to delete the project on the Mergin server, you need to first delete the files locally.

To delete a project, in the Browser panel, right-click on the project and select **Remove locally**. Once the project is deleted from the PC, you can remove it from the server by right-clicking on the project again and selecting **Remove from server**. Warning: this operation is not undoable and all data in the project will be permanently deleted.
