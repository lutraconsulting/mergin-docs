With the Mergin service, you can share your project with other Mergin users to view or contribute to it. There are two methods of sharing projects:

The first method is to go to the project setting and add user(s) with the type of permissions you'd like to assign to them. There are three types of permissions:

- Owner: can read, write, delete the whole project. Owner can also further share the project
- Write: can read and write the project data
- Read: can only view the project and data (including project history)

Another method which is more suitable for sharing with a large number of users is to send them a link to your private project. If a user does not have access to the project, there will be a button to request access:

Once the user requests access, the project owner(s) can open the project settings and grant them the appropriate permission:
