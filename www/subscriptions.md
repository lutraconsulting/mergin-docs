Mergin Service offers a free plan for up to 100 MB data usage. For more storage you can choose one of the
two plans for users ("Individual" 1GB or "Pro" 10GB storage). 

As an organization you can subscribe to 50GB "Team" plan. Organizations are more flexible in user management
and have finer control over individual project sharing. Also we support extended invoicing and support
options for the organizations.

If you want to have On-Premise deployment or looking for other options, please contact us directly.

Subscription plans can be bought from the Input app (on Apple devices via in-app purchases)
or through the Mergin Web (via Stripe platform). 

Your subscription will auto-renew, either annually or monthly until you unsubscribe. You can cancel or 
change your subscription any time, with Apple Manage Subscriptions App or through the Mergin web interface.

For more information, do not hesitate to contact us.
